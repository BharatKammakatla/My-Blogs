## ‚ú°Ô∏è Selenium Python Automation Framework - How to build ?

Python is easy to learn and simpler to code when compared with other traditional languages. Nowadays, software development is making a transition towards python. Taking into consideration the holistic view of  a software product, most of the companies are more inclined to maintain the same stack of technology in software development and testing life cycles. In this blog, I will put forward to you the steps and the process of how to build a Selenium Test Automation Framework in python. For a full working code, kindly refer to my  [Github repo](https://github.com/BharatKammakatla/Selenium-Python-Framework).

- Create a python project. You can choose an IDE of your own. However, I have preferred to use PyCharm as it is most industry wide used.
- Create a new Virtual Environment. 
- Create a package named `tests`. Entire framework is be divided into divided into different packages. Other would be subsequently created in later steps.
- Create a class for each testcase. Every testcase should be implemented as pytest method `ex: def test_e2e(self)` and every pytest method should be wrapped under a class.
- Use fixtures for *setup* and *teardown* methods. Place the browser invocation and closure codes inside fixtures.
- Generalise the fixture methods for all testcases by placing them in `contest.py` file. 
- Create a `utilities` package and place all the reusable classes, methods there. Doing so makes our code less reductant.
- Create a Base class inside utilities package and call the fixture there `@pytest.mark.usefixtures("setup")`. Inherit `Base` class to all the testcases.
- Create a package `resources`. Place browser drivers `(ex: chromedriver.exe, geckodriver)`, input_data files, etc there.
- Pass command line arguments to select browser at runtime. Means we should be able to select which browser we need to run our cases on. `(ex: py.test --browser_name=chrome)`. Use `pytest_addoption(parser)` method and `request.config.getoption("browser_name")` function to achieve this.
- Implement pageObject mechanism:
     - Create a package named pageObjects.
     - Create separate classes for each page `(ex: HomePage, LoginPage, BookingPage, etc)`.
     - Define constructor which will initialize the driver which was passed form the testcases.
     - Define objects and their locators as class variables
     - Define getter methods for each class variable.
- Create package actions. Define all the actions(like click, sendkeys, select, etc). Create and object for actions in each testcase and use actions object to call all the actions.
- Also if there are any other reusable functions, you can place them in Base class inside utilities package.
- Implement the logging feature. Use `logging` package to achieve this.
- Implement HTML reports: Use `pytest-html` to achieve this. Run the cases with `--html=report.html` parameter which helps us to create html reports. 
- Also add screenshots for failed cases. To achieve this we should tweak few functions inside pytest-html package, you can find the tweaked code in the my framework code.
- Parameterize data from external excel sheet using `openpyxcl` library.
